# An RGB-Chain controlled by the ESP-01
This is an project to control a RGB-chain with the ESP-01 by WiFi.
The Esp-01 will programmed by the Arduini IDE and fit in a selfmade circuit board which will replace the old one of the RGB-chain.

## Components
To run the project you need some components. 
You find a list of them [here]().

## Folder structure
Exery folder has its own readme for more details.
- [components](https://github.com/bitifeye/esp8266-01_rgb-chain/blob/master/component_list.txt)
  Here will you find a list of all components you need.

- [pcb](https://github.com/bitifeye/esp8266-01_rgb-chain/tree/master/pcb)
  Here will you find informations about the circuit board.

- [src](https://github.com/bitifeye/esp8266-01_rgb-chain/tree/master/src)
  In this folder is the sourcecode.
  You will also find some information how to use it.
  
## Possible extensions of the project
- The circuit board has the opportunity to receive th IR-signal from the old remote controler.
  But the code for that aren't implemented yet.
